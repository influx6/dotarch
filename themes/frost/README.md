# Frost

Frost is a simple, elegant, and dark theme for Omarchy inspired by the serene beauty of frost patterns on a winter morning. It's designed for those moments of deep focus, when clarity emerges from simplicity and all that's left is you and your code.

> In winter's hush, where crystals form,  
> Against the dark, the cool lights warm.  
> Each line of code, a crystal bright,  
> In frost's domain, where thoughts take flight,  
> And focused minds weather any storm.
