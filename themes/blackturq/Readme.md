# Black Turq

Inspired by the anodised‑ink colour pattern of my Evo80 keyboard, this theme fuses deep black with vibrant turquoise accents to create a modern, high‑contrast workspace.
Designed for the Omarchy environment, it balances sleek minimalism with vivid detail to keep your focus sharp.
Built out of passion for custom hardware aesthetics and functional beauty — because your system deserves to look as good as it performs.
