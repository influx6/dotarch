# Fireside

Fireside is a warm, cozy theme for Omarchy inspired by the gentle glow of a crackling fire. It brings the comforting ambiance of a winter evening indoors to your coding environment. Designed for those who appreciate subtle warmth and understated elegance, it creates a focused workspace as inviting as gathering around a hearth.

> In ember's glow where thoughts take flight,  
> Code dances warm in flickering light.  
> Each line a spark, each function bright,  
> By fireside's grace, through endless night,  
> The developer's craft burns ever bright.
